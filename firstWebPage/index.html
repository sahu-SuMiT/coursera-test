		<p>Trees are our best friends because they clean the air we breathe. Likewise, they also clean the water and soil and ultimately make the earth a better place. It is also a fact that people who live near trees are healthier, fit, and happier than people who do not.Moreover, it is our responsibility to look after our friends who serve us in many ways. Most importantly by saving plants, we are not doing any favor to plants but to ourselves only. Because trees and plants life does not depend on us but our lives depend on them.Trees also provide us food and shelter. Many trees bear the fruits that serve as food for birds and animals. Human beings also relish various fruits such as mango, apple and banana to name a few. The leaves, roots and bark of trees are used to prepare medicines. Trees also provide shelter to animals and humans. Forests filled with huge, dense trees serve as habitat for wild animals and contribute towards rich biodiversity. Wood and other material extracted from trees is used to craft several things that are essential for a comfortable living.

		<p>On bile farms, bears are seen as mere production units, only worth the amount of bile they produce. Animals Asia has also seen instances of old or very sick bears – those who fail to produce bile – simply left to starve to death in their cages. Bear's bile is extracted using various invasive techniques, all of which cause severe suffering, pain and infection.The method claimed to be the most 'humane' by bile farmers, is 'free-drip' method, where bears undergo surgery to create a permanent open passage from their gallbladder through their abdomen.

		<h2>(#section3) Section 3 : &quot;Rescue cats and dogs&quot;</h2>

		<p>Animals Asia has rescued many dogs, cats, puppies and kittens who have suffered horrendous abuse at the hands of people who see them as 'pests' — such as puppy abuse, when the dog pictured below was scalded with boiling water and thrown from a high rise building. And kitten abuse, with a disabled kitten abandoned on the streets. And these are not the only dangers they face…

		<p>Trainers will do whatever they can to break the animals' spirits. Endangered tigers and lions routinely have their teeth ripped out and are declawed to render them harmless.A recent video viewed by 10 million people in China showed a trainer kicking and beating a chained and muzzled endangered moon bear. To attract tourists and generate more profits, some zoos and safari parks use wild animals, particularly baby wild animals, as photo props.

		<p>And if it’s been a while since your last date with a good book, the experts have a few reasons that might convince you to give it another go.

“One of the benefits to reading fiction is simply that it provides enjoyment and pleasure,” Melanie Green, PhD, associate professor in the department of communication at University at Buffalo, tells NBC News BETTER. “It can provide an escape from boredom or stress.”
